## Md-Wiki

Md-wiki is a wiki generator package in emacs. It can generates a series of markdown files, which could be deployed to site using some static site generator, such as hugo, hexo ...

Each page's relationship with other pages will be shown on top of each markdown file. It includes the 'parents' and 'children' of current page. The relationship will be generated according to a local 'mdwiki-tree' file which indicates the structure of all pages. You can easily create, delete or update a page just by modifying the structure tree.
